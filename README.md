# Text To 3D

An upcoming computer vision application designed to take a word and answers to some questions from the user and use this information to construct a 3D model for them.

It should be very user friendly and visually appealing.

The concept is that the computer will gather images of the object in question from various angles from the internet and use certain algorithms to estimate the positions of the 3D vertices and construct a pretty 3D model of the chosen object.

As for the questions i mentioned earlier, after recieving the general word for the object it should create. It asks for further descriptions in order to accurately depict what the user had in mind.

The 3D model can then be edited in the application as well as exported for editing in another one.

I will start with constructing low poly models and work my way up to higher poly ones.
